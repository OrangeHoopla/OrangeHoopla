<h2>Constraints</h2>

As of when this was written [JLCPCB][jlc] allows for a black silk screen with their SMT assembly, which when I had first created this was not that case. Alongside their library having a limited amount of ICs for this project.

<h2>NFC chip</h2>

the [NT3H1101W0FHKH][nfc] is a NFC(Near Field Communication) tag, to my knowledge the only available one that is a SMD.
The specs are
Operating frequency: `13.56 MHZ`
Data Transfer: `106 kbits/s`
Endurance : `500,000 cycles`
Memory: `64 bytes SRAM`
		`1904 bytes read/write`
I2C(future interface with micro controller?)

<h2>Antenna Design</h2>

[frequency formula](/images/business_card/form.gif)
we can assume the capacitance level of 50 pF as given by the data sheet under 13. Characteristics
[final](/images/business_card/fin.png)
giving us a value of 2.75 Î¼H needed for the antenna
at this point antenna design is a bit beyond myself so i used [ST][ant] to finish the design

<h2>Eagle Design</h2>

Thankfully the footprint for the [NT3H1101W0FHKH][nfc] was already completed online.

[anten](/images/business_card/antenna.png)
completed through the linked tool earlier.

and for the unique traces on the card [GF Williams][gf] made a amazingly useful tool available online
