Gross was supposed to hint at it being the `Gronsfeld Cipher`
a type of substition cipher based off of a matrix and key


needing the python library pycipher to use the built in function `Gronsfeld`

```python
import pycipher
msg = pycipher.Gronsfeld([1,2,3,4,5]).decipher('OQWKWPUVMYTIUSSTHHPI')
```
giving the flag `noob{NOTGROSSITSGRONSFELD}`
