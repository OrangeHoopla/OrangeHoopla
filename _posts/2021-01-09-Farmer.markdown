Probably one of the easier problems since we can assume the cipher is farmer related and the passcode is `noob` to decode the string
```
I watched this video tutorial but i don't understand what it takes to be a FARMER. video

I am noob can you help me??

Remember, noob can be a secret to your valuable plant

n+FP9N5Mo17rJQOmEWXU3/Pm4HFMTtb/3+iN+brp8Nk=
```
hints at using seed as the means to decrypt the message
using 

the command `openssl` we can decrypt the message

```bash
echo 'n+FP9N5Mo17rJQOmEWXU3/Pm4HFMTtb/3+iN+brp8Nk=' > crypt.txt
openssl seed-cbc -d -in crypt.txt -out answer
cat answer


```

giving the flag `noob{s33d_encryp7_1sn't_1t?}`
